`_handoff/content/*.md` is **locked at v1.6.2** (April 2026), aligned with brand spec **v1.8**. Do not paraphrase the wording. Canonical brand spec lives at `01-brand-system/drgladysz-brand-spec-for-claude-design-v1.8.md` (parent of `site/`); the canonical single-doc locked content lives at `01-brand-system/drgladysz-locked-content-home-and-about-v1.6.2.md`. The `_handoff/content/` files mirror the canonical with build-friendly per-page YAML frontmatter.

| 10 | Production cutover (DNS at Zenbox, monitor 404s, decommission WP after 30 days) | ⬜ | — |

**Phase 6/7/8 deferred work (content authoring, not infrastructure):**
- Phase 6: WordPress migration — **scaphoid-fractures published 2026-04-29** from the v1.7 implementation package (peer audience, FESSH-prep, 30 references, 16 glossary terms, JAMA Key Points box, MedicalScholarlyArticle JSON-LD, byline, no images yet — see "Phase 6 — what shipped" section below). Still to author: flexor-tendon-injuries-and-repair, extensor-tendon-injuries, and the Polish post (zespol-ciesni-nadgarstka).
- Phase 7: 5 more procedure pages — author one per sub-specialty area at minimum (e.g. one reconstructive-microsurgery, one skin-cancer) so each category index isn't empty at launch.
- Phase 8: Polish mirrors of all supporting pages (/pl/kontakt, /pl/uprawnienia, /pl/nota-prawna, /pl/polityka-prywatnosci, /pl/zastrzezenie-medyczne, /pl/publikacje) — pending Polish composition session.
- Phase 8: Resend-backed contact form. Currently the form posts as `mailto:` so it works without a server endpoint; adding a real `/api/contact.ts` server endpoint is part of Phase 10 (Vercel adapter setup).

Tier 2 features (calculators, MCQ, glossary) ship **post-launch** in months 1-12.

## Critical conventions and Astro 6 gotchas

These are non-obvious things prior sessions tripped on. Do not redo:

- **`output: 'static'`** — Astro 6 removed `'hybrid'`. Default `'static'` now does the same thing (per-page opt-in to SSR via `export const prerender = false`).
- **i18n routing is strict.** `prefixDefaultLocale: true` means top-level pages 404. All routes must live under `src/pages/en/` or `src/pages/pl/`.
- **Tailwind 4 ships as a Vite plugin**, not an Astro integration. `@astrojs/tailwind` is unmaintained for v6. Config: `import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'` in astro.config + `@import "tailwindcss"` and `@config "../../tailwind.config.ts"` in `src/styles/globals.css`.
- **Vite pinned to ^7** via `overrides` in package.json — Astro 6 requires it; npm pulls Vite 8 transitively without the pin.
- **`getImage()` takes `format` (singular).** `<Picture>` takes `formats` (plural). Easy to confuse — they look like the same prop.
- **Image pipeline**: photos in `src/assets/img/`, NOT `public/img/`. Astro only optimizes images imported from `src/`.
- **Image registry is per-page direct imports.** Lazy globs (`import.meta.glob` without `eager`) and dynamic-import switch statements both make Vite emit every glob target as a static asset, even unreached ones. The only thing that tree-shakes properly is direct per-page `import img12 from '@/assets/img/img-12.jpg'`.
- **LCP preload uses shared config.** `src/lib/image-config.ts` holds widths + quality + sizes constants. Both `<Picture>` (in PhotoBreak) and `getImage()` (in BaseLayout's `heroPreload`) must use identical options or the preloaded URL hashes diverge from what the picture element resolves and the browser fetches twice.
- **Astro dev-server CSS cache goes stale on structural refactors.** When a component's grid/layout CSS changes, Vite HMR sometimes serves the OLD compiled CSS even after a hard browser reload. The production build (`npm run build`) is correct; only dev is wrong. Symptom: `getComputedStyle(el).display` returns `block` when CSS says `grid`. Fix: `pkill -f "astro dev"` then `cd site && npm run dev` for a clean restart. Already cost two debug rounds in this session — restart pre-emptively after any AboutSection/Standfirst/grid-template refactor before judging visuals.
- **Astro scoped CSS doesn't reach slot content.** Component templates render with a `data-astro-cid-XXX` attribute; slot content from the parent does NOT get that attribute. So `<style>` rules inside the component only match elements rendered in the component's own template. To style slot content from the parent, use `:global(...)` selectors. Both Standfirst's `.aside-num`/`.aside-list` and AboutSection's equivalents are styled via `:global()` for that reason.
- **Readonly arrays don't cross into `<Picture>` props.** `IMAGE_WIDTHS` and `IMAGE_FORMATS` in `src/lib/image-config.ts` are `as const` (good for narrow typing), but `<Picture>` typings expect mutable arrays. At every call site spread them: `widths={[...IMAGE_WIDTHS]}`, `formats={[...IMAGE_FORMATS]}`. Forgetting this is a type error at build time, not runtime.

---

## Sanity

- **Project ID:** `kwp48q91`. Dataset: `production`. Manage at [sanity.io/manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage).
- **Studio runs standalone** via `npm run studio:dev` (port 3333). Not embedded in Astro at `/studio`. The skeleton's "embedded studio" plan needed `@sanity/astro` (not in deps); standalone is simpler. Revisit if/when embedding becomes needed.
- **Schema status:**

| Schema | Status |
|---|---|
| `author` | ✅ full |
| `article` | ✅ full (citation mark wired to `bibReference`) |
| `podcastEpisode` | ✅ full |
| `procedurePage` | ✅ full (Phase 5 — AO Surgery Reference 10-section structure) |
| `bibReference` | ✅ full (Phase 5 — Vancouver/AMA fields, was `reference`) |
| `callout` | ✅ shared object type (info / warning / pearl) |
| `glossaryTerm` | ✅ full (Phase 6 — Tier 2 schema pulled forward when scaphoid article shipped; rendering side ships alongside) |
| `mcqQuestion` | 🟡 stub — flesh out post-launch (Tier 2, Feature 4) |
| `calculator` | 🟡 stub — flesh out post-launch (Tier 2, Feature 3) |

- **Schema rename:** `reference` → `bibReference` because `reference` is reserved by Sanity (collides with the built-in document-reference type). All GROQ queries, schema files, and Studio config use `bibReference`. The user-facing Studio label is still "Reference (citation source)".
- **`useCdn: false`** on the Sanity client (`src/lib/sanity.ts`). Sanity's CDN can serve stale results for a few minutes after a publish, which during builds means a freshly published doc may be invisible to `getStaticPaths` even though it's queryable elsewhere. Build-time freshness > CDN read perf.
- **Schema deploy:** the schema needs to be deployed for the Sanity MCP `get_schema` tool to work and for any deploy-time schema validation. Run `npx sanity@latest schema deploy` from the local Studio after `sanity login`. Skipped this session because deploy needs interactive CLI auth; documents were created via MCP regardless. Studio reads schema from local files, so the editing UI is unaffected.
- Sanity ecosystem at v4 (current); v5 bump deferred — Phase 5 worked cleanly on v4 and bumping is a separate risk.

---

## Locale conventions (i18n)

- **English under `/en/`**, Polish under `/pl/`. Both prefixes always shown — never bare `/about`.
- **Polish content is independently composed** — never machine-translated from English. Awaiting native Polish composition session for Home, About, all procedure pages.
- **Polish slugs** (from brand spec §11): `/pl/o-mnie`, `/pl/zabiegi`, `/pl/publikacje`, `/pl/kontakt`, `/pl/uprawnienia`, `/pl/nota-prawna`, `/pl/polityka-prywatnosci`, `/pl/zastrzezenie-medyczne`.

---

## Brand details encoded in components

- **Wordmark / signature treatment:** `text-transform: lowercase` with `<span class="cap">M</span>` and `<span class="cap">G</span>` to keep the M and G uppercase. **No italic on the surname** in any context (Decision #5 in v1.8 spec, "no italic on the name in any context").
- **Master wordmark vs cover-spread variant** (v1.8 §2): site nav, all page heroes, and any in-running reference use the **master Plex Serif Medium 500**. The cover-spread Regular 400 variant is reserved for brand-book covers, document title pages, slide title slides only.
- **Footer signature** uses Plex Serif **Regular 400** (lighter than the master Medium 500 — a distinctive footer register), `clamp(28px, 3vw, 40px)`, lowercase + cap M/G, never italic.
- **OR-shot color treatment** (img-04, img-09, img-10, img-12): editorial Lightroom grading per v1.8 §3 (saturate teal -15-20%, lift shadows toward warm grey, push midtones toward yellow/red). The current site-wide PhotoBreak `saturate(0.96)` CSS matches the v1.6.2 mockups; per-image Lightroom grading is a Phase 9 finishing pass.
- **Marginal aside / Tufte sidenote pattern** (Standfirst, AboutSection): both components have a 2-column body+aside grid on desktop ≥900px (body left, ~200px mono aside right with 2px oxblood top-rule). The aside is a named `<slot name="aside">` so consumers can pass a marginal index, pulled keywords, structural metadata, or — in Phase 5 — citation references. On mobile, the aside stacks above the body to read as a section preview. Default fallback content is a 24px oxblood accent bar so the column never collapses visually. The home `Standfirst` populates the aside with a mono index of the three sub-specialty section headings ("Hand Surgery", "Reconstructive & Microsurgery", "Skin Cancer Surgery") — reusing locked labels as a marginal preview, not introducing new copy.

## Photo manifest quick reference

Full details in `_handoff/design/photo-manifest.md`. Primary tier:

| ID | Placement | Aspect | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `img-12` | Home hero | 4:5 | OR lights, no mask. Saturate 0.96. `HomeHero` component (Phase 3). |
| `img-13` | Canonical headshot — all square crops, social, OG fallback | 1:1 | Close-up, light blue blazer. Don't use as page hero. |
| `img-14` | About hero | 4:3 | Examination room, anatomical posters. |
| `img-19` | About break before research | 4:5 tall | Charcoal blazer, French doors. Max-height 90vh. |
| `img-08` | Section dividers across site | 16:9 | Surgical instrument tray, gold + steel. |
| `img-02` | Home break (specialties → publications) | 16:9 | Gloved hands, instruments. |
| `img-11` | Polish-only sterile-technique pages | 16:9 | Polish text in frame — restrict to `/pl/`. |

---

## Don'ts (forbidden by compliance / brand)

Per `_handoff/technical/compliance-checklist.md` and brand spec — these are non-negotiable:

- No testimonials, no carousels, no chat widgets, no tracking pixels.
- No patient images at MVP (RODO/MCNZ).
- No bespoke colors, font weights, or spacing values outside the locked design tokens.
- **First mention of FEBOPRAS / FEBHS / MD on each page must be expanded.**
- Performance budgets are hard: LCP ≤ 2.5s, CLS ≤ 0.05, INP ≤ 200ms.
- No JavaScript on content pages by default — only interactive features ship JS, via Astro Islands (`client:visible` / `client:idle`).

## Open items / decisions deferred

1. **Sanity API token rotation.** A read+write token was pasted in chat history during Phase 1 setup (2026-04-28). Rotate it in Sanity → Manage → API → Tokens, replace with a **read-only** token in `.env.local` (frontend doesn't need write). Studio uses session auth, no token. (Phase 5 used the Sanity MCP for seeding instead of the API token.)
2. **OR-shot color grading.** Editorial pass in Lightroom for img-04, 09, 10, 12 vs accepting current CSS `saturate(0.96)` approximation. Defer decision to Phase 9.
3. **Image storage strategy.** Currently 68MB of source photos in git history. Migrate to Sanity asset CDN if git size becomes annoying — schemas already designed for it.
4. **Polish content composition.** Native Polish session pending for Home, About, procedure pages, blog posts.
5. **Embedded vs standalone Sanity Studio.** Standalone now; revisit if you want `/studio` on drgladysz.com (would add `@sanity/astro` dep).
6. **Dependency major bumps.** Sanity 4→5, Resend 4→6, TypeScript 5→6, Preact Signals 1→2 are available. Phase 5 deferred the v4→v5 bump because the existing v4 worked cleanly with the new schemas; revisit when there's a feature reason to bump (rather than for its own sake).
7. **About hero pull-quote centering.** The §01 opening narrative paragraph is centered within its right-of-§-margin column rather than the full viewport (~52px right of viewport-center at 1440px). User said "looks fine for now"; if the slight off-center bothers anyone later, switch §01 to absolute-positioned in the margin so the narrow paragraph can center against the viewport.
8. **Favicon files.** `/favicon.svg` and `/apple-touch-icon.png` are referenced by BaseLayout but absent from `public/`. Console logs a 404 in dev. MG monogram favicons (16/32/180/192/512) per spec §2 and meta-and-seo.md — outstanding asset task.
9. **Sanity schema not deployed.** `npx sanity@latest schema deploy` requires interactive `sanity login` which Phase 5 couldn't run autonomously. Studio reads schemas from local files so the editing UI works either way; only the Sanity MCP `get_schema` tool and any deploy-time validation need the deployed schema. Run from a logged-in CLI session when convenient.
10. **Citation popover IDs duplicate when same ref cited multiple times in one doc.** `Citation.astro` builds `popoverId = cite-{refId}-{index}`. The bibliography index is per-ref (so the same ref cited twice gets the same number), which means the popover element is rendered twice with the same id — invalid HTML, though browser popover behaviour still works because both `popovertarget` buttons point at the same id. Fix: thread the markDef `_key` (already unique per occurrence) into Citation as a suffix. Low priority; affects the seeded procedure page which cites refs 1, 4, 5 twice each.
11. **`/en/blog` and `/en/procedures` index pages not built.** Phase 5 detail pages link back to these (and the home page links to `/en/blog`); they currently 404. Phase 6 builds the blog index; Phase 7 builds the procedures index.
12. **Article schema `author` field validation will reject seeded test article on a clean publish.** The seeded article references the seeded author UUID via the built-in Sanity reference type — that works. But if you re-seed without the author existing, the publish will fail validation. Author is a required reference. Worth knowing if you delete-and-reimport.

## Phase 5 — what shipped (citation system + procedure schema)

Phase 5 delivered the Tier 1 features specified in `_handoff/features/01-citation-system.md` and `02-procedure-schema.md`. Detailed change log in `PHASE-5-NOTES.md` (root of `site/`). Summary:

**Sanity schemas**
- `studio/schemas/bibReference.ts` — full Vancouver field shape (authors, journal, volume, issue, year, pages, PMID, DOI, PMCID, URL, pubType, editors/publisher for books, abstractPreview).
- `studio/schemas/procedurePage.ts` — AO Surgery Reference 10-section structure with required-field discipline (indications/anatomy/approach/keySteps/aftercare/complications/evidence required; contraindications/positioning/closure/patientSummary optional).
- `studio/schemas/callout.ts` — shared `info`/`warning`/`pearl` object type, used inline in both `article.body` and procedure clinical sections.
- `article.ts` citation mark now points at `bibReference` (the type was renamed from `reference` because Sanity reserves that name).

**Frontend**
- `src/lib/sanity.ts` — typed Sanity client + GROQ accessors + `extractCitationOrderFromBlocks()` (recursive walk that builds the per-doc bibliography order, traversing nested callout content too).
- `src/lib/citations.ts` — pure-JS Vancouver/AMA formatter (no `citation-js` runtime — kept the dep installed for future advanced cases). Handles ICMJE 6-author truncation, journal/book/chapter/online/guideline pubTypes, PubMed/DOI/PMC link assembly.
- `src/lib/schema.ts` — JSON-LD generators for `MedicalScholarlyArticle` (peer/expert audience), `MedicalWebPage` (patient audience), `MedicalProcedure`, plus a `BreadcrumbList` helper. Citations populate the `citation` array in JSON-LD.
- `src/components/content/Citation.astro` — superscript marker + `<aside popover="auto">` that floats into the right-gutter as a Tufte sidenote on desktop ≥1024px and behaves as a native HTML Popover on mobile. Zero JS shipped.
- `src/components/content/Bibliography.astro` — numbered Vancouver-formatted reference list at end of article; `id="ref-N"` anchors with sticky-header `scroll-margin-top` and `:target` highlight.
- `src/components/content/KeyPoints.astro` — JAMA-style summary box (Question / Findings (or Indications) / Meaning (or Clinical relevance)).
- `src/components/content/Callout.astro` — info / warning / pearl visual treatments.
- `src/components/content/PortableTextRenderer.astro` — custom Portable Text walker. Handles block styles (h2-h6, blockquote), bullet/number lists, callouts (recurses via `<Astro.self>`), images (Sanity CDN URLs), and the marks tree (em / strong / underline / strike-through / link / **citation** / glossaryTerm passthrough).
- `src/components/content/PortableTextSpan.astro` — span-level mark renderer; decorators stack from inside out, link wraps, citation appends a numbered superscript marker AFTER the span.

**Routes**
- `src/pages/en/blog/[slug].astro` — article detail page; `getStaticPaths` over Sanity articles. Layout reserves a 320px right gutter on desktop ≥1024px so floated citation sidenotes land in the margin without overlapping body. Mobile collapses the gutter and shows citations as native popovers from the inline marker.
- `src/pages/en/procedures/[slug].astro` — procedure detail page with the AO 10-section structure, in-page table of contents, numbered key steps with optional pitfall callouts, optional collapsible "For patients" plain-language summary, end-of-page bibliography.

**Seed content (live in Sanity)**
- 1 author (Mateusz Gładysz)
- 5 references on carpal tunnel syndrome literature: Atroshi 1999 (JAMA), Padua 2016 (Lancet Neurol), Phalen 1966 (JBJS), Louie 2012 (Hand), Vasiliadis 2014 (Cochrane). All have valid PMIDs/DOIs and abstract previews.
- 1 article: `/en/blog/carpal-tunnel-syndrome` (patient audience) — uses 3 of the references inline, demonstrates KeyPoints + pearl callout + 3 citation sidenotes.
- 1 procedure: `/en/procedures/open-carpal-tunnel-release` (peer audience) — full AO 10-section structure with all 5 references distributed, 4 numbered key steps with 2 pitfall callouts, patientSummary populated.

Build status: `npm run type-check` 0 errors, `npm run build` 4 pages (home, about, 1 article, 1 procedure), 105 image variants. The article and procedure HTML render with valid Schema.org JSON-LD (`MedicalWebPage` and `MedicalProcedure` respectively, each with a populated `citation` array).

## Phase 6/7/8 — what shipped (content infra + supporting pages)

The 2026-04-29 overnight session shipped infrastructure for Phases 6, 7, and 8 — a single push because the work was tightly related (index pages and supporting pages all share the same shell). Detailed change log in `PHASE-6-8-NOTES.md`.

**Routes added under `/en/`:**
- `blog/index.astro` — knowledge-base index. Groups articles by category in fixed editorial order (Patient information → Expert blog → FESSH prep → News & commentary). Empty categories suppressed; the page renders gracefully with one article today.
- `procedures/index.astro` — procedures index. Three sub-specialty sections with `id="hand-surgery"`, `id="reconstructive-microsurgery"`, `id="skin-cancer"` anchors so the home page Specialty Blocks now link cleanly into the right section.
- `contact.astro` — email + practice context + a `mailto:`-action form (no Resend server endpoint until Phase 10 adds the Vercel adapter).
- `credentials.astro` — explains MD / Facharzt / FEBOPRAS / FEBHS / MCNZ / PWZ / Swiss GLN with links to the relevant public registers.
- `imprint.astro` / `privacy.astro` / `disclaimer.astro` / `credentials.astro` / `consent.astro` (EN) and `nota-prawna.astro` / `polityka-prywatnosci.astro` / `zastrzezenie-medyczne.astro` / `uprawnienia.astro` / `zgoda.astro` (PL) — **all ten render the locked legal-pages-package** at `01-brand-system/legal-pages-package/`. Each route is a 5-line file that pulls the matching markdown from the `legal` content collection and renders via `LegalPageLayout`. Source markdown lives at `src/content/legal/{en,pl}/*.md` (verbatim copy of the package; do not edit there — update the canonical package and re-copy).
- `publications.astro` — full publications archive grouped by year. Currently 2 entries (JMIR AI 2026 + EBJ 2022); add to `PUBLICATIONS` array to extend.

**Legal pages content pipeline:**
- `src/content.config.ts` — `legal` collection with frontmatter zod schema matching the package's `_meta/manifest.json#frontmatterSchema`.
- `src/plugins/remark-section-masthead.mjs` — remark transform that recognises the locked `§ 0n — Theme` paragraph pattern and marks it with `class="section-masthead"` so the layout CSS renders it in Plex Mono small caps with oxblood accent (per package README "Required render conventions" point 1).
- `src/layouts/LegalPageLayout.astro` — wraps the rendered markdown in `SiteLayout` + `ContentPage`, builds the version + last-updated meta line in the page locale, and provides `:global()` CSS for `.section-masthead`, tables (rule-strong borders, mono caps headers per brand spec §2), and document-control trailing blocks.
- `astro.config.mjs` markdown.remarkPlugins — registers the section-masthead plugin globally so it applies to all markdown including future content collections.
- **Collection entry IDs are flat basenames** (e.g. `imprint`, not `en/imprint`) when using Astro v6's glob loader without a custom `generateId`. All 10 docs have unique basenames across en/ and pl/ so this works without collision; if a future page (e.g. `/en/x.md` and `/pl/x.md`) needs the same basename in both locales, configure the loader's `generateId` option.

**Shared component added:**
- `src/components/ContentPage.astro` — content-page shell used by all five supporting pages. Provides label/title/standfirst/meta header + a slot for body content. Body content uses `:global()` rules for h2/h3/h4/p/ul/ol/dl/blockquote so consumer pages can write plain HTML without re-declaring typography. Picks up the same serif-body / oxblood-accent / mono-cap-label register as the rest of the site.

**Sanity client extended:**
- `getAllArticleSummaries()` and `getAllProcedureSummaries()` — lightweight projections used by the index pages. Avoids pulling full Portable Text bodies just to render cards.

**Home page tweak:**
- The Specialty Blocks links at `/en/index.astro` switched from `/en/procedures/<category>` to `/en/procedures#<category>` so they land on the existing procedures-index anchor. Reverts to slash-form when dedicated category pages ship.

**What's still required to launch (Phase 9 QA):**
- Author 3 more articles (scaphoid-fractures, flexor-tendon-injuries-and-repair, extensor-tendon-injuries) so the home Articles teaser links resolve.
- Author 1-2 more procedures so each procedure-index category isn't empty.
- Polish-language `Contact` and `Publications` pages — these are the ONLY supporting pages without Polish mirrors (the legal pages all have PL mirrors via the locked legal-pages-package). Wait for the Polish composition session.
- Resend-backed contact form server endpoint — Phase 10 (needs Vercel adapter).
- Formal lawyer review (NZ + PL) of all five legal documents — queued for October 2027 per legal-pages-package `_meta/README.md`.
- Verification of live registry entries: PWZ 2985148 on rejestr.nil.org.pl, MCNZ 93463 on mcnz.org.nz (per package open items list).

Build status after the session: `npm run type-check` 0 errors. `npm run build` 12 pages. Working tree dirty (no commits — held off so you can review the diff).

## Phase 6 — what shipped (scaphoid-fractures expert article)

The 2026-04-29 session published the first long-form expert article (`/en/blog/scaphoid-fractures`) from the v1.7 implementation package at `01-brand-system/articles/scaphoid-fracture/`. Peer audience, FESSH-prep, 4,500 words, 30 references, 16 glossary terms.

**User decisions for the four real gaps the package didn't cover:**
- Glossary tooltip rendering pulled forward (Tier 2 Feature 5 partial — schema + component, not the index/detail pages).
- `glossaryTerm` schema extended to its full Tier 2 shape (per `_handoff/features/05-glossary-system.md`) so the package YAML's `category`/`synonyms`/`relatedTerms`/`termPolish`/`fullDefinition` data isn't lost.
- Author byline component added (was hard-coded in footer only; schema's `author` reference field was unused on the article page).
- Heroless publish — `heroImage` is optional in the schema; figures are added incrementally as Mateusz authors the SVGs and sources the AnatomyStandard CC-BY images.

**Schema and component changes**
- `studio/schemas/glossaryTerm.ts` — extended from a 3-field stub to the full Tier 2 shape (term/termPolish/slug/category enum/shortDefinition/shortDefinitionPolish/fullDefinition+Polish blocks/synonyms tags/relatedTerms refs/illustration/notesForMateusz). Schema not yet deployed (open item #9 still applies); local Studio reads from file, so authoring works.
- `src/components/content/GlossaryTerm.astro` — NEW. Modeled on `Citation.astro`. Renders a dashed-underline `<button>` trigger and `<aside popover="auto">` showing term, category (mono caps), and short definition. Per-occurrence unique `popoverId` via the markDef `_key` (avoids the duplicate-id pattern of `Citation.astro` open item #10). Zero JS, native Popover API. The locked spec's "More about this term →" link is suppressed for now — `/en/glossary/[slug]` index/detail pages remain Tier 2.
- `src/components/content/PortableTextSpan.astro` — wires the `glossaryTerm` mark. When a span has a glossary mark, the text is wrapped in `<GlossaryTerm>` instead of being emitted as plain HTML. Decorators and link wrapping are skipped on glossary spans (a `<button>` can't legally nest inside an `<a>`); the article body convention puts plain text inside `[gloss:...|...]` markers, so this is a non-issue in practice.
- `src/components/content/PortableTextRenderer.astro` — accepts and forwards a `glossaryTerms` prop alongside `references`, including down into recursive `<Astro.self>` callouts.
- `src/lib/sanity.ts` — added `SanityGlossaryTerm` type, `getGlossaryTermsByIds()`, `extractGlossaryOrderFromBlocks()` (refactored alongside `extractCitationOrderFromBlocks` into a shared `extractMarkOrderFromBlocks()` walker filtered by mark type). `ARTICLE_PROJECTION` now projects `author->{name, credentials, title, role}` instead of the raw `_ref`. `SanityArticle.author` typed as `ArticleAuthor | null` — null when the reference is unresolved.
- `src/pages/en/blog/[slug].astro` — fetches glossary docs via `extractGlossaryOrderFromBlocks` after the citation extraction; passes them to `<PortableTextRenderer>`. Author byline rendered as `<p class="article-byline">` between title and standfirst, mid-dot-separated (`Mateusz Gładysz · MD · FEBOPRAS · FEBHS`). Defensive byline logic: extracts post-nominal segments from whichever of `credentials` or `title` matches the all-caps comma-separated pattern (Phase 5 had populated these two fields the wrong way round in the seeded author doc).

**Author doc patched**
- The Phase 5 seed put the role string ("Consultant Plastic and Hand Surgeon") into the `credentials` field and the post-nominals ("MD, FEBOPRAS, FEBHS") into a non-schema `title` field. The seed script (`site/scripts/seed-scaphoid-article.ts`) patches the author doc on every run: `credentials` ← post-nominals, `role` ← position title, `title` unset. Idempotent. The `[slug].astro` byline logic remains defensive (handles either layout) so newly authored author docs that follow the schema also work.

**Import pipeline**
- `scripts/import-scaphoid-article.ts` — pure Node script (uses `node --experimental-strip-types`, no `tsx` dep) that reads the four package files (`02-article-body.md`, `03-article-metadata.yaml`, `04-references.yaml`, `05-glossary-terms.yaml`) and emits a single JSON file containing `bibReferences[]`, `glossaryTerms[]`, and `articles[]` ready for seeding. Strips the authoring blockquote and the standfirst (which goes into `excerpt`, not body). H2-only headings (h3+ and lists are forbidden by the package and the script throws if encountered). Em-dashes pass through verbatim — no smart-typography pass. Citation marks (`[ref:slug]`) attach to the trimmed preceding text (drops the conventional pre-marker space so the rendered output is `text¹,` not `text¹ ,`). Glossary marks (`[gloss:slug|displayed]`) emit a span whose text is the displayed string with a `glossaryTerm` markDef pointing at `glossary-{slug}`. Stable `_key`s (`b1`, `s1`, `c1`, `g1`, …) ensure idempotent re-runs.
- `scripts/seed-scaphoid-article.ts` — one-shot seeder that uses `@sanity/client.createOrReplace()` (honors slug-form `_id`s, unlike Sanity MCP `create_documents_from_json` which always assigns fresh UUIDs). Three-stage flow: patch the author doc → seed 30 bibReferences → seed 16 glossary docs in two passes (without `relatedTerms` first to avoid circular cross-references like `scaphoid` → `avn` → `snac-wrist` → `scaphoid`, then patch each doc's `relatedTerms`) → seed the article. Idempotent (safe to re-run). Requires `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` in `.env.local`; intended to be revoked at sanity.io/manage immediately after the seed.
- `js-yaml` + `@types/js-yaml` added to devDeps for YAML parsing in the import script. `tsx` not added — Node 24's `--experimental-strip-types` is sufficient for ad-hoc TS scripts.
- `scripts/.scaphoid-import.json` (the import script's intermediate output) and any other `scripts/.*.json` are gitignored as transient artefacts; regenerable via `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/import-scaphoid-article.ts > scripts/.scaphoid-import.json`.

**Documents seeded into Sanity (production dataset)**
- 30 `bibReference` docs with slug-form `_id`s (`gelberman-menon-1980`, `dias-swifft-2020`, …, `bssh-girft-2024`). Plus 5 carpal-tunnel refs from Phase 5 = 35 total.
- 16 `glossaryTerm` docs with `glossary-{slug}` `_id`s. Cross-references via `relatedTerms` patched in pass 2.
- 1 `article` with `_id: article-scaphoid-fractures`. Plus 1 carpal-tunnel article from Phase 5 = 2 total.
- Author doc (UUID `2cbd8bcc-…`) patched: credentials ← `MD, FEBOPRAS, FEBHS`, role ← `Consultant Plastic and Hand Surgeon`, `title` unset.

**Build status after the session:** `npm run type-check` 0 errors, `npm run build` 19 pages (was 12 before; +1 article + +6 image variants). The article HTML renders with valid `MedicalScholarlyArticle` JSON-LD including a 30-entry `citation` array. Verified inline: byline `Mateusz Gładysz · MD · FEBOPRAS · FEBHS`, italic standfirst, JAMA Key Points (Question/Findings/Meaning), 49 numbered citation superscripts, 17 dashed-underline glossary triggers, 30 bibliography entries in document order, 49 em-dashes preserved as U+2014 (zero `--`), `Last clinically reviewed 29 April 2026`. Hero image suppressed cleanly when undefined.

**Image asks outstanding** (8 figures referenced by `06-image-manifest.yaml`, none uploaded):
- 3 from anatomystandard.com (CC-BY): `scaphoid-vascular-anatomy-diagram` (hero), `scaphoid-bone-morphology`, `snuffbox-anatomy-clinical-exam`
- 5 original SVGs Mateusz to author: `herbert-classification-figure` (replaces a legacy textbook screenshot), `imaging-pathway-algorithm`, `screw-trajectory-illustration`, `snac-staging-progression`, `decision-framework-flowchart`

**Quietly dropped (schema doesn't have the fields):** `relatedArticles`, `relatedProcedures` from the package metadata YAML. Cross-linking is manual until those fields are added.

**Open items added in this phase:**
- Citation popover-id duplication (open item #10) is now materially active — the scaphoid article cites multiple refs many times each. Same fix path (thread `_key` into `popoverId`).
- Schema deploy still pending (open item #9). The extended `glossaryTerm` lives only in local files until a logged-in `npx sanity@latest schema deploy` happens.
- Write token rotation (open item #1) — the Phase 6 seed used a temporary write token; revoke at sanity.io/manage → API → Tokens after each seed session.

## Phase 9 starting context (next session)

Phase 9 is **pre-launch QA — compliance, performance, accessibility**. See `_handoff/technical/compliance-checklist.md` for the full list.

**Recommended sweep:**
1. Lighthouse audit on each route — confirm LCP ≤ 2.5s, CLS ≤ 0.05, INP ≤ 200ms (the perf budgets in the don'ts list above).
2. axe / WAVE accessibility audit — focus on the new supporting pages (forms, dl semantics) and the citation popovers (focus management, escape behaviour).
3. Compliance audit — run through `_handoff/technical/compliance-checklist.md` line by line. Particular attention to: no testimonials, no patient images, expanded post-nominals on first appearance per page, footer disclaimer band on every page (already implemented in `SiteFooter.astro`).
4. Polish composition session — once locked PL content exists, mirror all `/en/...` routes under `/pl/...` per the `routing-and-redirects.md` slug table.
5. Schema deploy — run `cd site && npx sanity login` then `npx sanity@latest schema deploy` so the deployed schema matches local for any third-party validators.

**Things NOT to start yet:**
- Tier 2 features (calculators, MCQ, glossary) — post-launch.
- Vercel deployment — Phase 10.
